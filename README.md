## Overview
### Description
FOODIE - A food centered app to share, teach, and learn about cultures through food around the world.

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Social, lifestyle
- **Mobile:** There are many user interaction in the app community: users will be able to take food pictures and share in a post on the platform. Users will also be able to view restraunts in selected region's map and mark them down. Users can also view, comment, and like others' posts.
- **Story:** The value of the app is clear - to share, teach, and learn about cultures through food around the world. As a foodie, I was always looking for a platform that's specific to food-sharing but there's almost none in the market. Many people also take a large amount of time to look for good restraunts because resources are not concentrated in one platform. The app story solves this problem and goes beyond to connect people through food.
- **Market:** We mainly focus on young people who are active on social media and looking to learn more about cultures, or simply want to find a nice restraunt to hang out with friends. The app can be helpful when other age groups are planning a trip locally or to other regions since food is always an important part when we visit new places.
- **Habit:** Average users will consume the content on the app and sometimes create their own post to showcase a restraunt they like or share a receipt. The platform is interactive and habit-forming because this app serves as a centralized platform for food info.
- **Scope:** The goal is clearly defined. It is doable to complete an MVP where users can post and interact with other posts + a map function to view local restraunt so users can bookmark them. An addtional feature can be the app will help users to set up a meal-together with strangers (if they would like to connect with new friends) or friends.
