## Overview
### Description
FoodieWIKI - A food centered app to bookmark and learn about cultures through food around the world.

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Lifestyle
- **Mobile:** Users will also be able to view restraunts in selected region's map and mark them down. User can filter restraunts based on their choices.
- **Story:** The value of the app is clear - to learn about cultures through food around the world. As a foodie, I was always looking for a platform that's specific to food-searching but there's almost none in the market. Many people also take a large amount of time to look for good restraunts because resources are not concentrated in one platform. The app story solves this problem.
- **Market:** We mainly focus on young people who are looking to learn more about cultures, or simply want to find a nice restraunt to hang out with friends. The app can be helpful when other age groups are planning a trip locally or to other regions since food is always an important part when we visit new places.
- **Habit:** Average users will consume the content on the app. The platform is habit-forming because this app serves as a centralized platform for food info.
- **Scope:** The goal is clearly defined. It is doable to complete an MVP where users can view local restraunt and bookmark them.
